      This is a site intended for posting podfic, filk, and other
      fannish audio. If you can make an argument that it belongs
      here, it probably does. If you can't, please don't submit it.
    </li>
    <li>
      Don't upload copyrighted music or other copyrighted audio
      except as allowed by USA fair use rules- we don't want to
      get in trouble, and we're based in the USA. Follow relevant
      laws for your country as well.
    </li>
    <li>
      Get permission to podfic other's works. We don't check you
      on this- but if we get complaints from the writer, your work
      may be taken down.
    </li>
    <li>
      Please maintain backups of your own works! While we will
      make a strong effort to keep files from getting lost or deleted, this site
      is very much in beta and it is possible that data may be
      lost.
    </li>
    <li>
      Don't be a jerk. Don't harrass other users in any way.
    </li>
    <li>
      For the time being, I'm moderating these manually. Please
      have patience as I work through the queue.
